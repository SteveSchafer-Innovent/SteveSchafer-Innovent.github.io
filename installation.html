<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>
The easiest way to get this plugin is to use the Eclipse Update Manager.  
</p>
<p>
This project shares an update manager with several other sites, but the update site allows
you to pick and choose and only grab the plugins that you want.
</p>
<p>
If you are familiar with using the Eclipse Update manager, then all you will need is the update URLs.
</p>
<p>
For BIRT 2.5.1 and later the update URL is "http:/steveschafer-innovent.github.io//2.5.2".  Full update instructions are <a href="install_251">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
For BIRT 2.3.2 the update URL is "http://steveschafer-innovent.github.io/2.3.2".  Full update instructions are <a href="install_232">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
When deploying to a ReportEngine you need to be move the plugin jar files to the 
plugins directory of your Report Engine.  
</p>
<p>
If you are using a stand-alone container, place the jar in
	$BIRT_HOME/plugins.
If you are using a web based platform, the use the following directory:
	$WEB-INF/platform/plugins.
